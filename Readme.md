# MCP-Protocol-Mastery: Course Overview & Detailed Curriculum

---

## Part 1: The Foundational Layer & Course Overview

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard that enables seamless integration between AI applications and external data sources and tools. This course, **MCP-Protocol-Mastery**, is a project-based guide to mastering the creation of dynamic, interoperable AI systems.

### Core Concepts: A "USB-C for AI Integrations"

Think of MCP as a "USB-C for AI integrations." Just as a USB-C port allows different devices to connect through one standard, MCP provides a universal way for AI models to plug into diverse data sources. This simplifies development and makes AI systems more flexible, scalable, and context-aware. Our course will explore the core primitives that make this possible:

- **Tools**: Functions that allow your AI to perform actions (e.g., querying an API).
- **Resources**: Data and files (e.g., from a database or file system) your AI can access.
- **Prompts**: Instructions and reusable templates that guide your model's behavior.
- **Host-Client-Server Architecture**: The fundamental structure that enables secure and dynamic interactions.
- **Elicitation & Sampling**: Primitives for handling user interaction and human-in-the-loop workflows.

### Why This Course Matters

By adopting MCP, you can build dynamic AI agents that interact with the real world, not just static training data. This course will teach you how to leverage MCP to create agents that can check calendars, fetch files, or query databases without needing bespoke code for each task. With OpenAI's recent adoption of MCP in its Agent SDK, now is the perfect time to master this crucial skill.
